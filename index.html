          Pround prince is about to go to war with his father. The phrase "Proud
          prince" suggests that the prince is confident, arrogant, or stubborn,
          which might be contributing to the conflict with his father. Going to
          war with one's own family member is a serious and emotional decision,
          so there must be some deep-seated issues or differences between them.
